# RomanNumerals
Roman Numeral coding challenge

Here is the solution to the coding challenge for the OIT computer programming position. I programmed this in C++ using visual studio and I used 4 hours to complete it.

If I had more time, I would program a way to prevent the user from entering more then three consecutive roman numerals in a row. I would accomplish this by implementing 
either a roman numeral counter or an array of some sort to keep track of it.
